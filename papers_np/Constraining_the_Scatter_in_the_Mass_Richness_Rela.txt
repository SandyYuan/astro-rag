Abstract:
We measure the logarithmic scatter in mass at fixed richness for clusters in
the maxBCG cluster catalog, an optically selected cluster sample drawn from
SDSS imaging data. Our measurement is achieved by demanding consistency between
available weak lensing and X-ray measurements of the maxBCG clusters, and the
X-ray luminosity--mass relation inferred from the 400d X-ray cluster survey, a
flux limited X-ray cluster survey. We find \sigma_{\ln
M|N_{200}}=0.45^{+0.20}_{-0.18} (95% CL) at N_{200} ~ 40, where N_{200} is the
number of red sequence galaxies in a cluster. As a byproduct of our analysis,
we also obtain a constraint on the correlation coefficient between \ln Lx and
\ln M at fixed richness, which is best expressed as a lower limit, r_{L,M|N} >=
0.85 (95% CL). This is the first observational constraint placed on a
correlation coefficient involving two different cluster mass tracers. We use
our results to produce a state of the art estimate of the halo mass function at
z=0.23 -- the median redshift of the maxBCG cluster sample -- and find that it
is consistent with the WMAP5 cosmology. Both the mass function data and its
covariance matrix are presented.
