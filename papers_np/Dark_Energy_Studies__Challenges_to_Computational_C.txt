Abstract:
The ability to test the nature of dark mass-energy components in the universe
through large-scale structure studies hinges on accurate predictions of sky
survey expectations within a given world model. Numerical simulations predict
key survey signatures with varying degrees of confidence, limited mainly by the
complex astrophysics of galaxy formation. As surveys grow in size and scale,
systematic uncertainties in theoretical modeling can become dominant. Dark
energy studies will challenge the computational cosmology community to
critically assess current techniques, develop new approaches to maximize
accuracy, and establish new tools and practices to efficiently employ globally
networked computing resources.
