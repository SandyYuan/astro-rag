Abstract:
Constraining the distribution of small-scale structure in our universe allows
us to probe alternatives to the cold dark matter paradigm. Strong gravitational
lensing offers a unique window into small dark matter halos ($<10^{10}
M_\odot$) because these halos impart a gravitational lensing signal even if
they do not host luminous galaxies. We create large datasets of strong lensing
images with realistic low-mass halos, Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
observational effects, and galaxy light from HST's COSMOS field. Using a
simulation-based inference pipeline, we train a neural posterior estimator of
the subhalo mass function (SHMF) and place constraints on populations of lenses
generated using a separate set of galaxy sources. We find that by combining our
network with a hierarchical inference framework, we can both reliably infer the
SHMF across a variety of configurations and scale efficiently to populations
with hundreds of lenses. By conducting precise inference on large and complex
simulated datasets, our method lays a foundation for extracting dark matter
constraints from the next generation of wide-field optical imaging surveys.
