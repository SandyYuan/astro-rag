Abstract:
Over the next five years, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)
will use 10 spectrographs with 5000 fibers on the 4m Mayall Telescope at Kitt
Peak National Observatory to conduct the first Stage-IV dark energy galaxy
survey. At $z < 0.6$, the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) will produce the most
detailed map of the Universe during the dark energy dominated epoch with
redshifts of >10 million galaxies over 14,000 deg$^2$. In this work, we present
and validate the final BGS target selection and survey design. From the Legacy
Surveys, BGS will target a $r < 19.5$ magnitude-limited sample (BGS Bright); a
fainter $19.5 < r < 20.175$ sample, color-selected to have high redshift
efficiency (BGS Faint); and a smaller low-z quasar sample. BGS will observe
these targets using exposure times, scaled to achieve uniform completeness, and
visit each point on the footprint three times. We use observations from the
Survey Validation programs conducted prior to the main survey along with
realistic simulations to show that BGS can complete its strategy and make
optimal use of `bright' time. We demonstrate that BGS targets have stellar
contamination <1% and that their densities do not depend strongly on imaging
properties. We also confirm that BGS Bright will achieve >80% fiber assignment
efficiency. Finally, we show that BGS Bright and Faint will achieve >95%
redshift success rates with no significant dependence on observing conditions.
BGS meets the requirements for an extensive range of scientific applications.
BGS will yield the most precise Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Redshift-Space
Distortions measurements at $z < 0.4$. It also presents opportunities to
exploit new methods that require highly complete and dense galaxy samples (e.g.
N-point statistics, multi-tracers). BGS further provides a powerful tool to
study galaxy populations and the relations between galaxies and dark matter.
