Abstract:
The Dark Energy Survey (DES) will use a new imaging camera on the Blanco 4-m
telescope at CTIO to image 5000 square degrees of sky in the South Galactic Cap
in four optical bands, and to carry out repeat imaging over a smaller area to
identify and measure lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae. The main imaging area
overlaps the planned Sunyaev-Zel'dovich survey of the South Pole Telescope. The
idea behind DES is to use four distinct and largely independent methods to
probe the properties of dark energy: baryon oscillations of the power spectrum,
abundance and spatial distribution of clusters, weak gravitational lensing, and
Type Ia supernovae. This white paper outlines, in broad terms, some of the
theoretical issues associated with the first three of these probes (the issues
for supernovae are mostly different in character), and with the general task of
characterizing dark energy and distinguishing it from alternative explanations
for cosmic acceleration. A companion white paper discusses the kind of
numerical simulations and other theoretical tools that will be needed to
address the these issues and to create mock catalogs that allow end-to-end
tests of analysis procedures. Although we have been thinking about these
problems in the specific context of DES, many of them are also relevant to
other planned dark energy studies.
