Abstract:
The next generation of wide-area sky surveys offer the power to place
extremely precise constraints on cosmological parameters and to test the source
of cosmic acceleration. These observational programs will employ multiple
techniques based on a variety of statistical signatures of galaxies and
large-scale structure. These techniques have sources of systematic error that
need to be understood at the percent-level in order to fully leverage the power
of next-generation catalogs. Simulations of large-scale structure provide the
means to characterize these uncertainties. We are using XSEDE resources to
produce multiple synthetic sky surveys of galaxies and large-scale structure in
support of science analysis for the Dark Energy Survey. In order to scale up
our production to the level of fifty 10^10-particle simulations, we are working
to embed production control within the Apache Airavata workflow environment. We
explain our methods and report how the workflow has reduced production time by
40% compared to manual management.
