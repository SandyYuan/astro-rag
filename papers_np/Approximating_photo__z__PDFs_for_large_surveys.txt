Abstract:
Modern galaxy surveys produce redshift probability density functions (PDFs)
in addition to traditional photometric redshift (photo-$z$) point estimates.
However, the storage of photo-$z$ PDFs may present a challenge with
increasingly large catalogs, as we face a trade-off between the accuracy of
subsequent science measurements and the limitation of finite storage resources.
This paper presents $\texttt{qp}$, a Python package for manipulating
parametrizations of 1-dimensional PDFs, as suitable for photo-$z$ PDF
compression. We use $\texttt{qp}$ to investigate the performance of three
simple PDF storage formats (quantiles, samples, and step functions) as a
function of the number of stored parameters on two realistic mock datasets,
representative of upcoming surveys with different data qualities. We propose
some best practices for choosing a photo-$z$ PDF approximation scheme and
demonstrate the approach on a science case using performance metrics on both
ensembles of individual photo-$z$ PDFs and an estimator of the overall redshift
distribution function. We show that both the properties of the set of PDFs we
wish to approximate and the chosen fidelity metric(s) affect the optimal
parametrization. Additionally, we find that quantiles and samples outperform
step functions, and we encourage further consideration of these formats for PDF
approximation.
