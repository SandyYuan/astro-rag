Abstract:
The Las Campanas Distant Cluster Survey (LCDCS), which contains over 1000
cluster candidates at z>0.3, is a unique sample with which to probe the
evolution of both cluster galaxies and the properties of the cluster
population. Programs are now underway to utilize the LCDCS for both purposes.
We provide a brief overview of these programs, and also present new results for
the LCDCS cluster correlation function. Utilizing well-defined, approximately
dispersion-limited subsamples, we measure the angular correlation function for
clusters at z~0.5. Spatial correlation lengths are then derived via Limber
inversion. We find that the correlation length depends upon mass, as
parameterized by the mean cluster separation, in a manner that is consistent
with both local observations and CDM predictions for the clustering strength at
z=0.5.
