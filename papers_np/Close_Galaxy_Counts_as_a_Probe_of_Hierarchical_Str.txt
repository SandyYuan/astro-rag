Abstract:
Standard LCDM predicts that the major merger rate of galaxy-size dark matter
halos rises rapidly with redshift. The average number of close companions per
galaxy, Nc, is often used to infer the galaxy merger rate, however, recent
observational studies suggest that Nc evolves very little with redshift. Here
we use a "hybrid" N- body simulation plus analytic substructure model to
predict Nc directly. We identify dark matter subhalos with galaxies and show
that the observed lack of close pair count evolution arises because the high
merger rate per halo at early times is counteracted by a decrease in the number
of halos massive enough to host a galaxy pair. We compare our results to data
compiled from the DEEP2, SSRS2, and the UZC redshift surveys. Observed pair
counts match our predictions if we assume a monotonic mapping between galaxy
luminosity and the maximum circular velocity that each subhalo had when it was
first accreted onto its host halo. This suggests that satellite galaxies are
significantly more resilient to destruction than are dissipationless dark
matter subhalos. We argue that while Nc does not provide a direct measure of
the halo merger rate, it offers a powerful means to constrain the Halo
Occupation Distribution and the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos.
Interpreted in this way, close pair counts provide a useful test of galaxy
formation processes on < 100 kpc scales.
