Abstract:
The physical size of the sound horizon at recombination is a powerful source
of information for early-time measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$, and
many proposed solutions to the Hubble tension therefore involve modifications
to this scale. In light of this, there has been growing interest in measuring
$H_0$ independently of the sound horizon. We present the first such measurement
to use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), jointly
analyzing the full-shape galaxy power spectra of DESI luminous red galaxies,
emission line galaxies, quasars, and the bright galaxy sample, in a total of
six redshift bins. Information from the sound horizon scale is removed from our
constraints via a rescaling procedure at the power spectrum level, with our
sound horizon-marginalized measurement being driven instead primarily by the
matter-radiation equality scale. This measurement is then combined with
additional sound horizon-free information from Planck+ACT CMB lensing,
uncalibrated type Ia supernovae, and the DESI Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We
agnostically combine with the DESY5, Pantheon+, and Union3 supernova datasets,
with our tightest respective constraints being
$H_0=66.7^{+1.7}_{-1.9},~67.9^{+1.9}_{-2.1},$ and $67.8^{+2.0}_{-2.2}$ km s-1
Mpc-1. This corresponds to a sub-3% sound horizon-free constraint of the Hubble
constant, and is the most precise measurement of its kind to date. Even without
including information from the sound horizon, our measurement is still in
2.2-3.0$\sigma$ tension with SH0ES. Additionally, the consistency between our
result and other measurements that do rely on the sound horizon scale provides
no evidence for new early-Universe physics (e.g. early dark energy). Future
DESI data releases will allow unprecedented measurements of $H_0$ and place
strong constraints on models that use beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics to ameliorate
the Hubble tension.
