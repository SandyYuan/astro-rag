Abstract:
The flux ratios of gravitationally lensed quasars provide a powerful probe of
the nature of dark matter. Importantly, these ratios are sensitive to
small-scale structure, irrespective of the presence of baryons. This
sensitivity may allow us to study the halo mass function even below the scales
where galaxies form observable stars. For accurate measurements, it is
essential that the quasar's light is emitted from a physical region of the
quasar with an angular scale of milli-arcseconds or larger; this minimizes
microlensing effects by stars within the deflector. The warm dust region of
quasars fits this criterion, as it has parsec-size physical scales and
dominates the spectral energy distribution of quasars at wavelengths greater
than 10$\mu$m. The JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) is adept at detecting
redshifted light in this wavelength range, offering both the spatial resolution
and sensitivity required for accurate gravitational lensing flux ratio
measurements. Here, we introduce our survey designed to measure the warm dust
flux ratios of 31 lensed quasars. We discuss the flux-ratio measurement
technique and present results for the first target, DES J0405-3308. We find
that we can measure the quasar warm dust flux ratios with 3% precision. Our
simulations suggest that this precision makes it feasible to detect the
presence of 10$^7$ M$_\odot$ dark matter halos at cosmological distances. Such
halos are expected to be completely dark in Cold Dark Matter models.
